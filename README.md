## 📌 Problem Statement

Solar panels can develop several defects — like bird droppings, dust accumulation, physical or electrical damage — that reduce their efficiency. The goal of this project is to automatically detect and segment such defects using YOLOv9c-seg, improving maintenance workflows and power-output monitoring.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

```
User uploads image (Frontend)
        ↓
Backend receives image → loads fine-tuned YOLOv9 model
        ↓
Model runs prediction → returns defect class + confidence
        ↓
Result saved to MySQL database (Aiven)
        ↓
Result displayed to user (Frontend)
```

## 👥 Team Structure

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Model Training** | Training YOLOv9c-seg on normal & thermal images (Colab) |
| **Integration** | Connecting trained models to the backend |
| **Backend** | Flask/FastAPI server, model inference script |
| **Frontend** | User interface for image upload and result display |
| **Database** | MySQL schema design and Aiven cloud setup |

---

## 🏷️ Classes

The model detects and segments **6 defect types**:

1. 🐦 Bird-drop
2. ⚠️ Defective
3. 🌫️ Dusty
4. ⚡ Electrical-Damage
5. ✅ Non-Defective
6. 💥 Physical-Damage

## 📊 Results

After training the YOLOv9c-seg model on the custom Solar Panel Defect Detection dataset from Roboflow:

| Metric | Bounding Box | Segmentation Mask |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Precision | 0.786 | 0.779 |
| Recall | 0.715 | 0.689 |
| mAP@50 | 0.776 | 0.736 |
| mAP@50–95 | 0.583 | 0.501 |

## ⚙️ Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Google account (for Colab & Drive)
- Aiven account (for database)

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install ultralytics mysql-connector-python flask pillow torch torchvision
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder (never commit this):
```
DB_HOST=your_aiven_host
DB_PORT=your_port
DB_USER=avnadmin
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=defaultdb
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Training (Google Colab)
- Open either notebook in `notebooks/`
- Run all cells from top to bottom
- The last cell saves the fine-tuned model to Google Drive

### 2. Backend
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

### 3. Frontend
- Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser
- Upload a solar panel image
- View the defect detection result

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- `.pt` model files are stored in **Google Drive** (not GitHub — too large)
- Database credentials are stored in `.env` (not committed to GitHub)
- `ca.pem` SSL certificate is required for Aiven database connection (share privately with teammates)
- Always run `git pull` before making changes to avoid conflicts
